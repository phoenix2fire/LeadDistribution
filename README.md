Lead Distribution Application (In-Memory)

Problem satement:

You are working for a Chicago based insurance company which distributes leads gathered from its website to its network of agents.  The manufacturer has divided the city into the following regions; North, South, East and West.
Inside each territory, agents are assigned leads in a rotation.  If a new agent is hired they will go to the front of the queue for the next lead.  If an agent leaves, they are removed from the rotation. Currently there are 3 agents in the North, 4 in the South, 8 in the East and 6 in the West.
Sample lead
Name: John Doe
Territory: North
Interest: Health Insurance
Etcâ€¦

Answer: 
Territory: North
Assigned Agent: Agent 2 (Agent 1 was the last assigned in the territory)

Your job is to create the function that takes in a lead and assign it to the appropriate territory and the next dealer in line. The definition of the function signature is completely up to you.
